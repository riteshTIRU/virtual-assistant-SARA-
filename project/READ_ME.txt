------READ ME------
so before you execute any program:
1. Create database (in my case name of database : record)
2. Create table (in my case , table name : rem )
	   attribute 		datatype
	1. Date_Time		datetime
	2. info			varchar(100)	

Recommandation : I would recomend you to keep the name of all attribute ,database and table same as me other wise you will face difficulty to find and change the name in my code.									
		

ON LINE 32 IN speak.py is the statement to use for connecting our code to database.

my virtual assistant name is "SARA".
execute "hotward_detection.py".
after that say "SARA" then our virtual assitant will be activate.
